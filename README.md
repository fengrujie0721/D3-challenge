# D3-challenge
Analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings. Run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Include state abbreviations in the circles.


Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Smokes vs. Age

Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.

Place additional labels in scatter plot and give them click events so that users can decide which data to display.
