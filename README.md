Analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings. Run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.

Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
